# Bowling Challenge


### Approach

First of all I made a diagram to understand how the function had to communicate, what 'methods' they should have.
Then following the TDD i started to create the first launch method which generate a score and then started making
an interface using html and JQuery.

## How to use it

Clone the repo
Go in the Jquery file, and in the line 7 and 12 you can choose how much u want the score will be for each throw.
(we where not supposed to make it random)
Then run the index.html file placed in the views folder.
Enjoy!
